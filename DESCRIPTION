Description: The ~inlist~ package provides presumably more convinient
    version of 'apply' for lists with table like structure via its
    ~inlist~ function. Each list's element is bound to enviroments where
    filtering and selection is evaluated so its named elements are
    available as variables prefixed with ~.~. It also binds ~.~, ~..~,
    ~...~, ~.n~, ~.N~, ~..n~ and ~..N~ variables for accessing element
    itself, original list, elements indexing, length, etc.
