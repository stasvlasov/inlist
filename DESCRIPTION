Description: The ~inlist~ package provides a convenient way to subset and
    apply an expression on lists with a table like structure (i.e. list of
    lists with similar keys values sturucture). Its main function
    ~inlist(your_list, i, j)~ filters ~your_list~ by ~i~ and applies ~j~.
    For those familiar with ~data.table~ the ~inlist~'s interface is
    similar to ~data.table~'s ~`[`~ extractor method (i.e.,
    ~data.table:::`[.data.table`(dt, i ,j)~ means subset ~dt~ using ~i~
    and manipulate with ~j~). Each list's element is bound to environment
    where filtering (~i~) and selection (~j~) is evaluated However, unlike
    ~data.table~'s ~i~ and ~j~ list's named elements in ~inlist~ are bound
    to variables that are prefixed with ~.~. It also binds special
    variables ~.~, ~..~, ~...~, ~.n~, ~.N~, ~..n~ and ~..N~ variables for
    accessing the list element itself, the original list, elements' index,
    length of the list, etc. as well as a special function ~._()~ which
    can be used to subsitute default values when some list's elemenst are
    not available.
